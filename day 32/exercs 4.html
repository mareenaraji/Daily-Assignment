<h2 id="Machine Learning">Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Machine learning (ML) is a field devoted to understanding and building methods that let machines 
	"learn"	 that is, methods that leverage data to improve computer performance on some set of tasks.
	Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make 
	predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.Machine learning algorithms are 
	used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, agriculture, 
	and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed 
	tasks.A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making
	predictions using computers, but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical 
	optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining 
	is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.
	Some implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of
	a biological brain.</p>

<h2 id="Block Chain">Block Chain</h2>
<p>A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together 
	via cryptographic hashes.Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp,
	 and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). 
	 The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains 
	 information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with
	  each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in
	   that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all 
	   subsequent blocks.</p>

<h2 id="Internet Of Things">Internet Of Things</h2>
<p>The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability, 
	software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or 
	other communications networks. Internet of things has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be 
	connected to the public internet, they only need to be connected to a network, and be individually addressable. The 
	field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, 
	increasingly powerful embedded systems, as well as machine learning.Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless 
	sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently 
	and collectively enable the Internet of things</p>

<h2 id="Deep Learning">Deep Learning</h2>
<p>Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which is based on artificial neural networks. 
	It is capable of learning complex patterns and relationships within data. In deep learning,
	we don’t need to explicitly program everything. It has become increasingly popular in recent 
	years due to the advances in processing power and the availability of large datasets. Because 
	it is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) also known as deep neural networks (DNNs). 
	These neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain’s biological 
	neurons, and they are designed to learn from large amounts of data.</p>

<h2 id="Artificial Intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>The Artificial Intelligence tutorial provides an introduction to AI which will help you to 
	understand the concepts behind Artificial Intelligence. In this tutorial, we have also discussed
	 various popular topics such as History of AI, applications of AI, deep learning, machine learning, 
	 natural language processing, Reinforcement learning, Q-learning, Intelligent agents, Various search 
	 algorithms, etc. Our AI tutorial is prepared from an elementary level so you can easily understand 
	 the complete tutorial from basic concepts to the high-level concepts.</p>
